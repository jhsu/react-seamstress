# Introduction

Seamstress allows you to declaratively style complex React components with custom `:pseudo-selectors`.

Check out the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/namuol/react-seamstress/tree/master/examples) for simple code samples.

If you want quick introduction that explains the use-cases of Seamstress, read [`Why.md`](/Why.md).

An [API reference](/api/README.md) is also available.
